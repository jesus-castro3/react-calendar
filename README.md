# Calendar Task

## Steps
- npm install
- npm start

## NOTE
 - Can add events
 - Can delete events
 - Can edit events
 - API call to weather app, click on search after querying a city
 - Events will order correctly
 - Added redux for state management, needs more separation of concerns, just one have big action file and one big reducer file.
 - Ability to scroll through calendar, (data won't persist though, leaving a month will erase current month data)
 - In terms code might need a bit of a refactoring, might do later after tech review.
